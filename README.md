**Smart Grid Optimization: Integrating Renewable Energy for Sustainable Power Systems**

**Problem Statement:**
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(1) Considering the past 5 years of data provided, predict total power generated (p) for the first 3 months of 2024 at an hourly granularity. (Independent variables for first 3 months of 2024 for consideration is shared in a separate file.)
<br/>
<br/>
(2) For above problem you need to merge all 20 files data as an final input file. Which will be consisting of Date time, Air, Pressure, wind speed and Power generated variables.
<br/>
<br/>
(3) Considering this total power generated (p), prepare a database such that the generated power is distributed to 3 different consumption nodes (refer the 4-Node Star Architecture) with Node 1 will be taking 20% of total power, Node 2 will be taking 45% of total power and Node 3 will be taking 35% of total power generated respectively.
<br/>
<br/>
(4) Use this existing and the newly prepared dataset to determine the Stability (“stability”, Dependent Variable) of the power Grid.
<br/>
<br/>
(5) For above problem you need to consider Grid folder data consisting of price per unit, unit consumption, and grid stability report on hourly basis. Also, you need to add Power generated and stored at each Node(predicted during 3rd step)
<br/>
<br/>
(6) Final report can be presented different ways.
a. For instance, participants could analyze the output to determine the percentage of 'Stable' and 'Unstable' grid conditions over the span of three months. This analysis would provide valuable insights into the overall stability trends of the grid during the specified time period. Additionally, they could delve deeper to identify patterns in the hours when the grid is most prone to instability. By examining the frequency and duration of 'Unstable' conditions throughout the day, participants can uncover the specific time ranges when grid instability is most prevalent. Such insights can inform grid operators about potential vulnerabilities and enable them to implement proactive measures to mitigate instability risks during these critical hours.
